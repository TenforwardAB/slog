# Contributing to This Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document will guide you through the contribution process and explain the Git workflow we use.

---

## Overview

We use a **Trunk-Based Development** workflow with **feature branches** and **pull requests (PRs)** to manage changes.

- The `main` branch is always stable and deployable.
- All development is done in short-lived branches created from `main`.
- Changes are merged into `main` via pull requests.
- Releases are tagged on `main`.

---

## Understanding the Workflow

### Trunk-Based Development (Simplified)

1. All work starts from the `main` branch.
2. You create a short-lived branch for your change (feature, fix, etc).
3. When done, you open a pull request (PR) into `main`.
4. The PR is reviewed, tested, and merged (usually with squash merge).
5. Tags are created for releases.

### Why This Workflow?

- Simple and intuitive for contributors
- Easy to review and test changes
- Keeps history clean and linear
- Avoids confusion with multiple long-lived branches
